COVID Convetions was a small data project that used to provide information about statues of various convention in Poland and Germany, the way they were postponed or cancelled and if when they are going to happen, if announced and not cancelled. The dataset is probably not very suitable for machine learning, but it is still an interesting historical record and might be helpful for someone like me, who wants to attend as many conventions as possible. 

Most of the convention are anime conventions (or fantasy convention with an anime part), with some important exceptions. The difference between what is a convention and what is a meet-up matters – although many German anime meetups are just small anime convention in Polish classification (e.g. many Animexx meet-ups), yet I didn't include them on my list, just because there are too many of them and therefore it is too much hassle.

The list was meant to be update from time to time, but I didn't have time for that.

The data is published in 2 formats – an integrated OpenDocument Spreadsheet file, with all date snapshots available and a series of CSV files with every snapshot in a separate file, with `;` as the cell separator and new line as the entry separator.

The information might be outdated at the moment you check it, these are just dated snapshots after all, before you make a decision about going to a convention you should check the event's website/social media or websites like [Animexx.de](https://animexx.de) or [Konwenty Południowe](https://konwenty-poludniowe.pl).
